This project is a fork of **Zyk Mod**, which is itself a fork of [OpenJK](https://github.com/JACoders/OpenJK). The aim is to improve on the work Zyk has done and move the project into a different direction: Player Roleplaying as opposed to an "RPG" game.
This mod will be geared towards the RP community mainly. It will have features to prevent common occurences such as "spec-hiding", "Mary-sues" and more! It will also contain features that help player immersion.
